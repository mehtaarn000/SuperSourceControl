# SuperSourceControl (not recommended for use)
A local version control system written in Go. I built this as a way to introduce myself to Golang.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/mehtaarn000/SuperSourceControl
go build ssc.go
```
Then, move the `ssc` executable to somewhere in your path.

## Usage
Simpily run `ssc --help` to see usage.
